File-based vs Code-based

File-based Routing (NextJs)
- No extra boiler-plate code required for File-based routing. (Instead of writing, we just create files as routes)
- Intuitive system
- File + folder structure (in pages/folder) influences routes
- Navigation works with <Link> component and imperatively

Code-based Routing (React + react-router)
- Boilerplate setup in code required (<Switch>, <Route>, ...)
- Straightforward but includes new components + concepts
- File + folder setup does not matter at all
- Navigation works with <Link> component and imperatively
